npm run dev

## The idea behind the example

This example features how to use [emotion](https://github.com/tkh44/emotion) as the styling solution instead of [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx).

We are creating three `div` elements with custom styles being shared across the elements. The styles includes the use of pseedo-selector and CSS animations.


This is based off the with-glamorous example.
